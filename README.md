Hi, I'm Ajay Kumar! 
I am a passionate Robotics, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence Trainer working full-time with RoboTree Robotics.

I have hands-on experience in delivering project-based technical training to students, focusing on practical learning using Arduino, ESP32, IoT systems, and AI concepts. Along with core robotics training, I actively promote digital awareness and technical skills among students.
